## Scripts 

`inversion_mwe.ipynb` is a 'Jupyter Notebook' which contains an annotated minimum working example for the inversion procedure described in the manuscript written in `python`. A compiled version of this `.ipynb` is given as `inversion_mwe.html` that displays the code and the outputs, and can be opened in any browser.

## Data

The data  

`topo.dat` is a 2D array of giving the elevations in metres for our study area. This was generated by downsampling the `SRTM1s` dataset to a grid of 200x200 m resolution. 

`geochem.dat` contains the geochemical concentration for a range of elements (in mg/kg) in sediments gathered from our 67 sample sites. See also [Lipp et al. 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JF005700). 

`fitted_samp_locs.dat` contains the location (on the model grid) for the _fitted_ sample sites. 

`samples.dat` gives further metadata for the samples as well as their full (projected) localities.
